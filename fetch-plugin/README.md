# Fetch Push plugin

A single Hermes Agent plugin that gives the Fetch iOS app push notifications —
without patching Hermes core and without any Apple Developer credentials on the
user's host. It is the productized replacement for the old approach of editing
`hermes_cli/web_server.py` / `tui_gateway/server.py` (which `hermes update`
wipes and which required each user to hold the `.p8`).

## How it works

```

                          pre_approval_request hook ────────────────▶│ fans out   │
                          (needs attention)                          └────────────┘
```

The plugin is **one installed package scanned by two independent systems in two
processes**, coupled only through the relay:

- **Runtime half** (`plugin.yaml` + `__init__.py`): loaded by the agent's
  `PluginManager` in the TUI / gateway / dashboard-chat process. `register(ctx)`
  wires two hooks:
  - `post_llm_call` — fires once per completed turn on **every** surface (phone,
    web dashboard, terminal), so a reply typed anywhere notifies the phone.
  - `pre_approval_request` — fires when the agent blocks on an approval /
    clarifying question / secret.
  Each hook fire-and-forgets an HTTPS POST to the relay's `/v1/push/events`.
- **Dashboard half** (`dashboard/manifest.json` + `dashboard/plugin_api.py`):
  loaded by the dashboard `web_server` process and auto-mounted at
  `/api/plugins/fetch/`, behind the dashboard's session-token auth. `/register`
  and `/unregister` proxy device tokens straight to the relay (no token DB on
  the host).
- **Headless relay runtime** (`_runtime.py`): successful relay setup starts a
  background loopback-only Hermes dashboard/API process with no browser window.
  The reverse tunnel stays alive after `hermes setup` exits, so the phone does
  not need a public dashboard, Tailscale, or an open browser tab.
- `_relay.py` is the shared relay client, loaded **by file path** from both
  halves (they don't share a Python import).

The relay holds the single Fetch APNs key and is the only component that talks
to Apple. This host only ever stores an anonymous, per-agent `agent_id` +
`agent_secret` (in `~/.hermes/push/fetch-relay.json`), minted automatically on
first use.

## Install (per user)

```bash
hermes plugins install brentmwarner/hermes-fetch-plugins/fetch-plugin --enable
hermes gateway restart      # (and restart `hermes dashboard` if running separately)
hermes setup                # choose Fetch, then scan/paste the setup link
```

Then open Fetch on the phone and allow notifications. No Apple account, no
`.p8`, no core edits, no public dashboard URL, and no browser tab to keep open.

## Configuration

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HERMES_FETCH_RELAY_URL` | hosted relay (`https://push.tryfetchapp.com`) | Point at a different / local relay. |
| `HERMES_FETCH_RELAY_REGISTRATION_TOKEN` | _(none)_ | Enrollment token, if the relay requires one. |
| `HERMES_FETCH_TUNNEL_ENABLED` | enabled by Fetch relay setup | Keep the agent-side reverse tunnel active for relay pairing. |
| `HERMES_FETCH_TUNNEL_DISABLE_DASHBOARD_AUTOSTART` | _(unset)_ | Opt out if you manage the local Hermes dashboard/API process yourself. |
| `HERMES_INBOX_ENABLED` | set by Fetch setup | Enable Fetch as a cron/webhook delivery target. |
| `HERMES_INBOX_HOME_CHANNEL` | `default` | Default Fetch inbox channel used by bare `--deliver fetch`. |
| `HERMES_INBOX_STORE_HOME` | running profile home | Optional relay-paired Hermes home whose `state.db` receives inbox sessions. |

For local development, run the relay from `server/push-relay/` and set
`HERMES_FETCH_RELAY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787`.

## Inbox delivery and thread affinity

Fetch owns the canonical Hermes delivery surface for proactive and cron output:

```bash
hermes cron create "every 15m" "Summarize the World Cup" --deliver fetch:world-cup
```

Delivery channels are normalized before persistence. Both `fetch:world-cup` and
the legacy `hermes_inbox:world-cup` spelling resolve to the same channel slug and
therefore the same deterministic Hermes session, `inbox_world-cup`. Bare
`--deliver fetch` uses `HERMES_INBOX_HOME_CHANNEL` (default `default`). Cron
responses delivered to the home channel are split by cron job id
(`inbox_cron-<job-id>`) so each scheduled job gets a stable thread instead of all
proactive output collapsing into one inbox.

This channel-thread affinity is enforced in the plugin because Fetch owns the
phone-side inbox UX; end users should not need to manually pick Hermes thread ids
or understand profile-specific platform names.

## Notes & limits

- **Restart required after install.** Hooks load once at agent startup. Fetch
  relay setup starts a headless dashboard/API process for the app path; restart
  a separately managed `hermes dashboard` only if you deliberately disabled
  Fetch autostart.
- **Under-notification.** `post_llm_call` only fires when a turn ends with a
  non-empty final response and wasn't interrupted. Tool-only / interrupted /
  empty turns don't push; genuine "needs attention" stalls are covered by the
  approval hook. Notifying on a silent stall would need an upstream core change.
- **Every surface pushes.** Because the trigger is `post_llm_call` (agent core),
  a reply to a Telegram/Slack message also pushes the phone. The relay de-dupes
  a short window and the app suppresses the banner for the thread you're already
  viewing; per-category prefs (`replies` / `attention` / `proactive` / `sound`)
  are honored server-side.
